# How it all works

The network assumes the following:

- customizable
- decentralized
- offline first
- no data collection

Users can deploy their "own" network and connect to others.
Each network can be customized.
Users can add multiple topics and share them public or private with some.
Private content can be made public, however, once content is public you cannot go back.

## customizable

everything enabled by default easy to disable. 
Remove any widgets you don't use. 

## decentralized

Run the network on your pc or smart-device there's no central server holding your data.
You can decide if you want to public your content or keep it to closed circle of fellows.
Consume other nodes on demand.

## offline first

Synchronize with others when connected uploading published content and downloading foreign content when connected.

## no data collection

We promise that absolutely no personal data is collected on the network, **ever**

Users can do a lot on social networks but everything is considered content that could be shared if the user wants to.

## content

A piece of content also known as "post" is a collection of texts, images, videos. It has meta data like timestamps & author and it has a title and topic assigned.

When a user created a piece of content he can either save it privately for himself, share it with specific nodes or a group of nodes. Groups of nodes can be managed by a user as they like they are simple lists.

> Note: once content is PUBLIC it will stay public and it cannot be deleted or put in private again. Users can edit it with an edit history visible to everyone

### lists

Lists are everywhere in our daily lifes. You can create lists as sole content or attach a list to a piece of content. List items can be voted if allowed so a list can act as a poll and they can be opened to other users for complementary. Clicking an item on a List will get you more information about that list item. A list item is a piece of content which can contain comments, metadata or even discussions.

### moderation and blocking

All content is moderated by everyone if they wish to. There's no blocking function since there are no bubbles users intend to collaborate on the platform instead of fighting each other.
You connect to another node and you'll get the public content.
Don't like some of it? Skip it or argue properly within the given topic.

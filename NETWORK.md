# How it all works

The network assumes the following:

- customizable
- decentralized
- offline first
- no data collection

Users can deploy their "own" network and connect to others.
Each network can be customized.
Users can add multiple topics and share them public or private with some.
Private content can be made public, however, once content is public you cannot go back.

## customizable

everything enabled by default easy to disable. 
Remove any widgets you don't use. 

## decentralized

Run the network on your pc or smart-device there's no central server holding your data.
You can decide if you want to public your content or keep it to closed circle of fellows.
Consume other nodes on demand.

## offline first

Synchronize with others when connected uploading published content and downloading foreign content when connected.

## no data collection

We promise that absolutely no personal data is collected on the network, **ever**

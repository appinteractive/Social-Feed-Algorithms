# How it all works

The network assumes the following:

- offline first
- decentralized
- customizable 
- no ads or data collection

Users can deploy their "own" network and connect to others.
Each network can be customized.
Users can add multiple topics and share them public or private with some.
Private content can be made public, however, once content is public you cannot go back.

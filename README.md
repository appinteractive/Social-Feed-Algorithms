# social feed algorithms

Ideas, discussions and prototypes for social feed algorithms that give the users what they are interested in but also sparks new ideas. 

This project intends to solve the issues of common newsfeed-algorithms using some new approaches.

## issues to fight

Social networks are a great way to express, learn and teach or just hang out. But not everyone is using a network the same way, some are looking for information, some for connections and others just watch funny cat videos all day long.

So how could an algorithm look that counters these inherent issues? What formula could be smart enough to brighten any users view if they just want to?

### missing out on fellows

No one can checkout 100+ Virtual Friends across networks each and every day, but you'll surely miss something great in between!

### self-censoring

In common networks you built out your bubble over time and that's it, most people will never see anything outside their own bubble because it's simply to much content.

### needle in a haystack

We all know that moment, you talk with a friend about an article you've read online and you can't remember that important piece of information then on your hunt to look it up you find yourself in a wild google search session.

### lose couples can still be friends

There is at current no relation between content, you've got your post on network x and it's comments, maybe some likes for dopamine.

### trust the sender but not the message

We all at least heard of someone beeing hacked sending messages around that look like they've been sent by a fellow. People commonly trust their peers on messages if they're privat or public.

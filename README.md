# social feed algorithms

Ideas, discussions and prototypes for social feed algorithms that give the users what they are interested in but also sparks new ideas. 

This project intends to solve the issues of common newsfeed-algorithms using some new approaches.

## riddles to solve

Social networks are a great way to express, learn and teach or just hang out. But not everyone is using a network the same way, some are looking for information, some for connections and others just watch funny cat videos all day long.

So how could an algorithm look that counters these inherent issues? What formula could be smart enough to brighten any users view if they just want to?

### missing out on fellows

No one can checkout 100+ Virtual Friends across networks each and every day and you'll surely miss something great in between!

### self-censoring

In common networks you built out your bubble over time and that's it, most people will never see anything outside their own bubble because it's simply to much content.

### needle in a haystack

We all know that moment, you talk with a friend about an article you've read online and you can't remember that important piece of information then on your hunt to look it up you find yourself in a wild google search session.

### lose couples can still be friends

There is at current no relation between content, you've got your post on network x and it's comments, maybe some likes for dopamine.

### trust the sender but not the message

We all at least heard of someone beeing hacked sending messages around that look like they've been sent by a fellow. People commonly trust their peers on messages if they're privat or public.

## HOW !?!?

okay let's do it one by one.

**missing out fellows**

one way we could solve this would be to give boosters into users hands. Think of it like mana in some rpg game as a resource that you can spent to "boost" content. A portion is consumed when used and it fills up again over time or by certain actions.

**self-censoring**

have related links and content at hand not somewhere on page 3854. "Follow the white rabbit principle".

**needle in a haystack**

> **idea:** remember these old a-z navigations? let's mix that up with a date or date range

**lose couples can still be friends**

add a list of related/suggested content ordered by weight.

**trust the sender but not the message**

the internet is full of fakenews and false messages which intend no good to the readers.

however instead of deleting fakenews we could take the approach to clearly flag them by crowd. This will enable users to hook them up again anytime among all the proof related to it so they can send it to others. Away from single source of truth to crowd verified information.
